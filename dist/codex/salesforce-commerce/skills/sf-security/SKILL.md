# sf-security

Implement Salesforce Commerce security across B2C and B2B platforms.

## Before Writing Code

Always fetch the latest official documentation BEFORE implementing security controls:

- **SLAS Security**: WebSearch "Salesforce SLAS OAuth 2.1 security guide 2026" and WebFetch official Commerce API docs
- **B2C Commerce Security**: WebSearch "Salesforce B2C Commerce security best practices 2026" and WebFetch the security reference
- **Salesforce Security Guide**: WebSearch "Salesforce security guide OWASP 2026" and WebFetch official documentation
- **PCI DSS Requirements**: WebSearch "PCI DSS v4 requirements ecommerce 2026" for current compliance standards

**Why:** OAuth flows, CSRF protection patterns, encoding modes, and PCI requirements evolve. Live docs ensure correct implementation of current security standards.

## Conceptual Architecture

### Authentication

**SLAS (B2C Commerce) -- OAuth 2.1 with PKCE:**

| Client Type | Flow | Use Case |
|-------------|------|----------|
| Public (browser/PWA Kit) | `authorization_code_pkce` | Guest and registered users |
| Private (server-side) | `client_credentials` | Guest sessions |
| Private (server-side) | `authorization_code` | Registered users |
| Any | Refresh token | Session extension |

PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is required for all public client flows. Guest tokens enable anonymous shopping before login.

**Salesforce OAuth (B2B Commerce):**

| Flow | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| Connected Apps | OAuth application registration |
| JWT Bearer | Server-to-server authentication |
| Web Server Flow | User authorization with redirect |

**Session Management:**
- Secure, random, unpredictable session IDs
- Token expiration with renewal handling
- Secure cookies: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite attributes
- Session invalidation on logout, timeout, or security events

**Token Lifecycle:**

| Token | Typical TTL | Storage |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Access Token | 30 minutes | Memory or httpOnly cookie |
| Refresh Token | 30 days | httpOnly cookie (never localStorage) |
| CSRF Token | Per request | Hidden form field or custom header |

### XSS Prevention

**B2C Commerce (ISML):**

| Encoding Mode | Context |
|---------------|---------|
| `htmlcontent` | HTML body text |
| `htmlsinglequote` / `htmldoublequote` | HTML attributes |
| `jshtml` | JavaScript strings in HTML |
| `jsonvalue` | JSON data |
| `uricomponent` | URL parameters |

Always use `<isprint>` with explicit encoding. Never use raw `${variable}` for user-controlled data. Set Content Security Policy headers to restrict script sources.

**B2B Commerce (LWC):**
- Automatic encoding in Lightning template expressions
- Lightning Web Security (LWS) replaces Locker Service (Spring '23+)
- Use `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` in JavaScript
- Use `lightning-formatted-*` components for safe rendering

### Content Security Policy

| Directive | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `default-src` | Fallback for all resource types |
| `script-src` | Allowed script sources (restrict to self and trusted CDNs) |
| `style-src` | Allowed stylesheet sources |
| `img-src` | Allowed image sources |
| `connect-src` | Allowed API/fetch targets |
| `frame-ancestors` | Clickjacking protection |

Configure CSP headers in Business Manager or via server configuration. Use `nonce` or `hash` for inline scripts rather than `unsafe-inline`.

### CSRF Protection

**B2C Commerce:** Validate tokens with `CSRFProtection.validateRequest()` in controllers. Generate tokens with `CSRFProtection.generateToken()`. Include hidden token fields in all state-changing forms. Use double-submit cookie pattern for AJAX.

**B2B Commerce:** Built-in Salesforce CSRF protection. `<lightning-input>` includes tokens automatically. `@AuraEnabled` Apex methods have CSRF protection.

### Input Validation

| Layer | Technique |
|-------|-----------|
| Client-side | HTML5 validation, JavaScript checks (UX only, not security) |
| Server-side | Whitelist validation, type checking, length limits |
| Form definitions | SFCC XML form definitions with validation rules |
| Query API | Parameterized queries -- never string concatenation |

Always validate on the server. Client-side validation is a convenience, not a security measure.

### PCI Compliance

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|---------------|
| Tokenization | Never store raw card numbers; use tokenized payment methods |
| SAQ-A Scope | Use hosted payment fields to minimize PCI scope |
| TLS 1.2+ | Enforce for all API communication and payment processing |
| Log Masking | No card data in application logs |
| Gateway | Use Salesforce Commerce Payments or validated third-party processors |

### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

**B2C Commerce:** Business Manager roles (Admin, Merchant, Content) with granular, site-specific permissions. Custom roles for organization-specific needs.

**B2B Commerce:** Salesforce profiles and permission sets. Buyer permissions control ordering (browse, cart, checkout, approve). Account hierarchy restricts visibility based on relationships.

**B2B Sharing Rules:**
- Organization-wide defaults set baseline visibility
- Sharing rules grant additional access to specific groups
- Account hierarchies provide implicit sharing up the chain
- Manual sharing for ad-hoc access grants

### OWASP Top 10 Protections

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Injection | Parameterized queries via Query API; input whitelisting |
| Broken Auth | SLAS/OAuth best practices; MFA where available; strong password policies |
| Sensitive Data Exposure | Salesforce Shield encryption at rest (B2B); TLS in transit; log masking |
| Security Misconfiguration | Disable dev features in production; change default credentials; suppress stack traces |
| Access Control | Authorization checks on every request; least privilege principle |
| Monitoring | Log authentication events, failed logins, suspicious activity |

## Best Practices

### Implementation
- Always encode output using the correct mode for context (HTML, JS, URL, JSON).
- Validate input at the boundary -- whitelist acceptable values, reject everything else.
- Implement CSRF protection on all state-changing operations.
- Enforce TLS 1.2+ for all communications.

### Credentials and Access
- Rotate API keys, client secrets, and certificates on a regular schedule.
- Grant minimum necessary permissions (least privilege).
- Restrict customer data access to authorized users and systems only.
- Store credentials in Business Manager services or Salesforce Named Credentials, never in code.

### Operations
- Log authentication events, failed login attempts, and suspicious activity.
- Audit code for security issues regularly; conduct penetration testing.
- Keep dependencies updated; scan for known vulnerabilities.
- Maintain an incident response plan for security breaches.
