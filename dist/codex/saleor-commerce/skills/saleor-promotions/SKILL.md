## Promotion Types

Saleor distinguishes between two promotion types that apply at different stages:

| Type | When Applied | Effect |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Catalog promotion | At product display time | Reduces the visible price on product listings and detail pages |
| Order promotion | At checkout time | Applies discount to the order total or specific lines during checkout |

### Catalog Promotions

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Timing | Applied before the product reaches the cart |
| Visibility | Customers see the discounted price on product pages |
| Price display | `undiscountedPrice` and `pricing.discount` show the original and savings |
| Stacking | Multiple catalog promotions can apply to the same product |

### Order Promotions

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Timing | Applied when conditions are met in the checkout |
| Visibility | Discount shown as a line discount or order-level discount |
| Conditions | Based on cart contents, order total, or specific products |
| Application | Automatic when conditions match -- no code required |

## Promotion Rules and Conditions

Each promotion contains one or more rules:

### Rule Structure

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Rule display name |
| `channels` | Channels where this rule applies |

Catalogue predicate conditions: `productPredicate`, `categoryPredicate`, `collectionPredicate`, `variantPredicate`. Order predicate conditions: `discountedObjectPredicate` (minimum subtotal), `totalPrice` (order total threshold).

## Gift Cards

Gift cards function both as a product type and as a payment method:

| Balance | Gift card has a remaining balance that decreases with each use |
| Partial use | Gift card can be used for partial payment; remainder stays as balance |

## Discount Stacking Rules

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Multiple catalog promotions | All matching promotions apply; discounts stack |
| Catalog promotion + voucher | Both apply; catalog discount reduces base price, voucher applies on top |
| Catalog promotion + order promotion | Both can apply; catalog reduces price, order promotion discounts checkout |
| Multiple vouchers | Only one voucher code per checkout |
| Voucher + manual discount | Voucher applies first; manual discount applies on remaining amount |
| Gift card + other discounts | Gift card applies after all other discounts as a payment method |

## Best Practices

- Use catalog promotions for sale prices visible on product pages; order promotions for cart-level discounts
- Use vouchers when a code-based redemption experience is required
- Set `startDate` and `endDate` on promotions to automate sale periods
- Use `usageLimit` and `applyOncePerCustomer` on vouchers to control distribution
- Test promotion stacking behavior in a staging environment before going live
- Use gift cards with expiration dates to manage liability
- Always specify channels on promotion rules to prevent unintended cross-channel discounts
