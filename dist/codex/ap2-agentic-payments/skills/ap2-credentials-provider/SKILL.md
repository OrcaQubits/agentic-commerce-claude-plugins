# AP2 Credentials Provider Implementation

## Before writing code

**Fetch live docs**:
1. Fetch `https://ap2-protocol.org/specification/` for Credentials Provider responsibilities
2. Web-search `site:github.com google-agentic-commerce AP2 samples roles credentials_provider` for reference implementation
3. Web-search `site:github.com google-agentic-commerce AP2 credentials provider tokenization DPAN` for tokenization details
4. Fetch `https://ap2-protocol.org/topics/privacy-and-security/` for security requirements

## Conceptual Architecture

### What the Credentials Provider Does

The Credentials Provider (CP) is the **payment credentials custodian** — a digital wallet that securely manages payment methods and handles tokenization:

1. **Stores payment credentials** — User's payment methods (cards, wallets)
2. **Provides payment method listings** — Returns available methods to Shopping Agent
3. **Handles tokenization** — Converts real credentials to DPANs (Digitized Primary Account Numbers)
4. **Validates Payment Mandates** — Verifies user authorization before releasing tokens
5. **Facilitates payment** — Provides credentials to Merchant Payment Processor
6. **Manages user identity** — Links user identity to payment methods

### Critical Security Role

The Credentials Provider is the **only entity that handles raw payment credentials**:
- Shopping Agents never see real card numbers
- Merchants receive only tokenized references
- PCI data stays within the CP's security boundary
- This role-based separation is fundamental to AP2's privacy model

### Agent Card

The Credentials Provider advertises:
- AP2 extension support
- Available payment method types
- Tokenization capabilities
- Authentication requirements (OAuth2 recommended)
- Endpoint URL (reference: port 8002, path `/a2a/credentials_provider`)

### Key Responsibilities

#### Payment Method Management
- Store user payment methods securely (PCI DSS compliance)
- Return available payment methods when queried by Shopping Agent
- Include method details sufficient for user selection (last 4 digits, card type, expiry)
- Never expose full card numbers to Shopping Agents

#### Tokenization
- Generate DPANs (Digitized Primary Account Numbers) for selected payment methods
- Bind tokens to specific transactions
- Handle token lifecycle (creation, validation, expiration)
- Support network tokenization standards

#### Payment Mandate Validation
- Receive Payment Mandate + user attestation from Shopping Agent
- Verify user authorization signature
- Verify mandate contents integrity
- Perform additional tokenization if needed
- Release credentials to Merchant Payment Processor upon valid mandate

#### Credential Release
When the Merchant Payment Processor requests credentials:
- Validate the Payment Mandate
- Resolve the token to real credentials
- Release credentials securely to the MPP
- Never release credentials without a valid Payment Mandate

### Payment Method Addition

If a user lacks eligible payment methods:
- CP instructs the Shopping Agent on the setup process
- May require a tokenization flow on CP's trusted surface
- Network/issuer security requirements enforced
- New method added before transaction can proceed

### Security Requirements

- PCI DSS compliance for credential storage
- Hardware security modules (HSM) for key management
- Encryption of all credential data at rest and in transit
- Secure token generation with proper entropy
- Rate limiting on credential access
- Audit logging of all credential operations

### Best Practices

- Never expose raw credentials to Shopping Agents — always tokenize
- Implement proper PCI DSS controls
- Use hardware-backed token generation
- Validate every Payment Mandate before releasing credentials
- Support multiple payment method types (cards, wallets, bank accounts)
- Implement proper session management for user interactions
- Log all credential access for audit compliance
- Handle token expiration and renewal gracefully
