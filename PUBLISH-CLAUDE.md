# Publishing to Claude Code's Public Plugin Directory

Anthropic operates a **hybrid distribution model** for Claude Code plugins:

1. **Decentralized** — anyone can host their own marketplace (this repo already does, via `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`)
2. **Centralized & curated** — Anthropic maintains [`anthropics/claude-plugins-official`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official), browsable at [**claude.com/plugins**](https://claude.com/plugins), with 100+ plugins from AWS, Google, Microsoft, Datadog, Auth0, Adobe, Figma, etc.

Listing in the centralized directory is the highest-leverage publishing step because the marketplace is **auto-added to every Claude Code install** — users can `/plugin install <name>@claude-plugins-official` with zero setup.

> **Important name disambiguation**: "Claude Marketplace" is two different things. The **Claude Code plugin directory** (this doc) is free, lists open-source CLI plugins, browsable at claude.com/plugins. The separate enterprise "Claude Marketplace" announced March 2026 is for ISVs selling Claude-powered apps to enterprise customers — different audience, different submission flow.

## Submission flow (the form)

Anthropic doesn't accept PRs to `claude-plugins-official` directly. Submit each plugin via the official form:

| Surface | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Short link | https://clau.de/plugin-directory-submission |
| Via Claude.ai | https://claude.ai/settings/plugins/submit |
| Via Console | https://platform.claude.com/plugins/submit |

Anthropic reviews each submission against quality/security standards. After review, your plugin is added to `claude-plugins-official` under `external_plugins/` with a pinned Git SHA. Some plugins receive an "Anthropic Verified" badge after additional review.

## What our 15 plugins look like to a reviewer

The audit is clean as of commit `5cc2155+`:

- Every `<plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` has: `name`, `version`, `description`, `author`, `repository` (with `directory` subpath), `homepage`, `keywords`, `license`
- Root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` enumerates all 15 with `name`, `description`, `version`, `source`, `author`
- The repo has the canonical `claude-code-plugin` GitHub topic (which drives community aggregators like claudemarketplaces.com automatically)

## End-user install (today, before official-directory listing)

Until each plugin lands in `claude-plugins-official`, users add this repo as a marketplace:

```bash
# Inside Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add OrcaQubits/agentic-commerce-skills-plugins
/plugin install ucp-agentic-commerce@agentic-commerce
/plugin install acp-agentic-commerce@agentic-commerce
# ... or browse with `/plugin` UI
```

## End-user install (after listing)

Once each plugin is approved into `claude-plugins-official`:

```bash
/plugin install ucp-agentic-commerce@claude-plugins-official
```

No `/plugin marketplace add` step — `claude-plugins-official` is auto-added when Claude Code starts.

## Suggested submission order

If you want to stage the submissions rather than blasting all 15 at once, the most strategic order is:

1. **UCP** — flagship protocol with Google/Shopify endorsement; strongest signal of repo quality
2. **ACP** — second flagship (OpenAI/Stripe); pairs naturally with UCP in the directory
3. **AP2** — third (Google/FIDO); rounds out the "protocols" cluster
4. **Stripe MPP** — fourth protocol; strongest payments story
5. The 4 popular e-commerce platforms (Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, BigCommerce) — high search volume
6. Salesforce Commerce — enterprise audience
7. The 3 modern open-source commerce platforms (Medusa, Saleor, Spree) — niche but growing
8. WebMCP + NLWeb + A2A — the "agentic web" cluster

Anthropic's reviewers see your prior approvals, so leading with the strongest plugins helps the rest land faster.

## Other discoverability surfaces (free, durable)

### 1. GitHub topics (DONE)

These topics are set on the repo and drive community aggregators that auto-populate from public sources:

- `claude-code-plugin` — the canonical convention (2,296 repos), drives claudemarketplaces.com indexing
- `claude-plugin`, `claude-skill`, `claude-code`
- `cursor-plugin`, `codex-cli-plugin`, `openclaw-plugin`, `gemini-cli-extension`

### 2. claudemarketplaces.com

Independent community aggregator (~140k monthly visitors). Auto-populates from public repos with the right topics + valid `marketplace.json`. No submission form needed — wait for indexing.

### 3. aitmpl.com/plugins

Another community aggregator. Same auto-discovery pattern.

### 4. awesome-claude-code

PR-based awesome list at https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code. Submit a PR adding entries for each plugin.

### 5. MCP Registry

If any plugin's value is primarily an MCP server (we mainly ship plugins WITH MCP knowledge, not server bundles, but UCP/ACP/AP2 have MCP server stubs), list at https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry separately.

## Updating a listed plugin

After a plugin is in `claude-plugins-official`:

1. Update the plugin's source (skills, agent, README, etc.) in this repo
2. Bump `version` in `<plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` AND in the root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
3. Re-run `python scripts/convert.py` to refresh all platform builds
4. Commit, push, **tag the new SHA**
5. Email Anthropic the new SHA (or wait for their next automated sync — the cadence isn't publicly documented)

`claude-plugins-official` pins to a specific SHA per plugin entry, so version updates require Anthropic to update the pin. Anthropic-Verified plugins get faster refresh cadence.

## Gotchas

- **"Anthropic Verified" is not granted at first submission** — it's an additional review after listing. Don't expect it on day one.
- **Trust warning still applies** — even listed plugins show the "we don't verify plugin behavior" warning unless Verified.
- **One submission per plugin** — submit them individually; don't try to batch.
- **Per-plugin descriptions must stand alone** — the directory UI shows the plugin's own description, not the marketplace's. Use the per-plugin templates above.
- **Name collisions** — your plugin name must be unique within `claude-plugins-official`. All 15 of our names are scoped enough to avoid collisions (e.g., `ucp-agentic-commerce` not `ucp`).
- **`docs.claude.com` 301-redirects to `code.claude.com`** in 2026 — both still work but `code.claude.com` is canonical.
- **Don't say "Claude Marketplace"** in marketing — it now means the enterprise app marketplace. Say "Claude Code plugin directory" or "`claude-plugins-official`".
