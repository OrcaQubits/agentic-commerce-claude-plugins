# AP2 Agentic Payments Plugin for Claude Code

A deeply expert Claude Code plugin for implementing the **AP2 (Agent Payments Protocol)** — an open protocol for secure, verifiable, and interoperable AI-driven payments in agentic commerce. Originally created by Google; contributed to the FIDO Alliance in April 2026, where it is now stewarded by the Payments and Agentic Authentication Technical Working Groups.

## Design Philosophy

This plugin is built to **stay current**:

- **Conceptual knowledge is baked in** — VDC framework, mandate types, role-based architecture, transaction flows, cryptographic signing, risk signals, and dispute accountability patterns that are stable across spec versions.
- **Implementation-specific details are fetched live** — the subagent and every skill instruct Claude Code to web-search and fetch the official docs before writing code, so you always get the latest schemas, SDK methods, and mandate structures.
- **Spec version is always cited** — generated code includes comments referencing the AP2 specification version it was written against.

## Installation

### Per-session

```bash
claude --plugin-dir "ap2-agentic-payments"
```

### Persistent

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "ap2-agentic-payments": {
      "type": "local",
      "path": "/path/to/agentic-commerce-claude-plugins/ap2-agentic-payments"
    }
  }
}
```

### Verify

Run `/agents` in Claude Code — you should see `ap2-agentic-payments:ap2-expert`.

## Using the Subagent

### Auto-delegation

Claude auto-delegates when your task involves AP2:

```
Build an AP2 Shopping Agent that handles card payments
```

```
Implement a Merchant Agent with Cart Mandate creation and signing
```

```
Add a Credentials Provider for payment method tokenization
```

### Explicit invocation

```
Use the ap2-expert subagent to implement Payment Mandate creation
```

### What makes it different

The subagent has `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` in its tool list. Before writing implementation code, it will:

1. Search for the latest spec version on ap2-protocol.org
2. Fetch the relevant specification page for exact mandate schemas
3. Fetch the SDK source for current type definitions and sample patterns
4. Write code against the verified-current spec, citing the version

## Hooks

The plugin includes lifecycle hooks that provide safety guardrails:

| Event | Trigger | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **PostToolUse** (async) | Write or Edit tool completes | Scans written code for PCI data (card numbers, CVVs), hardcoded payment tokens, Stripe keys, signing/device keys, and private key material. Reinforces AP2's role-based data separation: Shopping Agents must never access PCI/PII. Non-blocking. |

Hooks require Python in PATH.

## AP2 Protocol at a Glance

### The Three Fundamental Questions

| Question | How AP2 Solves It |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Authorization** | User-signed mandates prove agent had authority |
| **Authenticity** | Cryptographic VDCs prove intent is genuine, not hallucinated |
| **Accountability** | Non-repudiable audit trail determines liability |

### Six Roles

| Role | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **User** | Human who delegates purchase authority |
| **Shopping Agent** | AI orchestrator — coordinates the transaction |
| **Credentials Provider** | Payment credential custodian — tokenization |
| **Merchant Endpoint** | Seller — catalog, cart, fulfillment |
| **Payment Processor** | Financial processing — authorization, settlement |
| **Network/Issuer** | Payment networks (Visa/MC) and banks |

### Three Mandate Types (VDCs)

| Mandate | Scenario | Created By | Signed By |
|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Cart Mandate** | Human-present | Merchant | Merchant + User |
| **Intent Mandate** | Human-not-present | Shopping Agent | User |
| **Payment Mandate** | All transactions | Shopping Agent | User |

### Transaction Flows

**Human-Present** (20 steps):
```
User → SA → Merchant → Cart Mandate → User confirms → Payment → Receipt
```

**Human-Not-Present**:
```
User signs Intent Mandate → leaves → SA shops autonomously → Payment → Notification
```

### Protocol Stack

```
AP2 (Mandates, VDCs, Cryptographic Signing)
  ↑ extends
A2A (Agent-to-Agent Tasks, Messages, Parts)
  ↑ complements
MCP (Agent-to-Tool/Data Access)
```

### Related Protocols

| Protocol | Relationship |
|----------|-------------|
| **A2A** | AP2 extends A2A for payment-specific communication |
| **MCP** | AP2 MCP servers provide payment tools to agents |
| **UCP** | UCP operationalizes AP2 (Checkout = Cart Mandate) |
| **x402** | Complementary crypto payment method AP2 can support |
